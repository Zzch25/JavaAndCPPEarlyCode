A very early collection of CPP algorithms I wrote way back when, and some later Java ones! It's a collection I keep to show how far I've come.

Note there is obvious abuse of globals and more. It was my getting off the ground code. I was more concerned with the algorithms too. HOWEVER, by the later Java exercises it is apparent I've pretty much become well rounded and that an unerstanding of proper practices had developed.
